# Group Anagrams

This Python code takes a list of words and groups the anagrams together. Anagrams are words that have the same characters but in a different order.

# Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/group-anagrams.git
   
# Navigate to the project directory:
  cd group-anagram
# Run the code:
  python group_anagrams.py
  
Enter a list of words separated by spaces when prompted.
The program will display the grouped anagrams as output.

# Example:
Enter a list of words (space-separated): cat dog tac god act
Grouped Anagrams:
['cat', 'tac', 'act']
['dog', 'god']
